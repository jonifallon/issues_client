# Capstone Project - Docu-Paws

## Description

Docu-Paws is a single-page application that allows users to add and track pet health information including prescriptions (medication).  Upon login, users create, edit, view and delete pets or their meds/vaccines.  The app is designed to allow users to have information readily available when health questions arise, such as making a veterinarian appointment for an illness.

## API

I used Express/Mongo to create the backend.  I needed two resources in addition to users:

- pets
- prescriptions

After determining the types of attributes that would be needed for each resource, we started by creating a controller and filled it with actions associated with the appropriate CRUD actions. Using the attributes, we also created the schema from within each of our resource models and updated the routes file to reflect the new resources. Express/Mongo allowed us the flexibility to add in attributes as we saw fit, which was valuable when we created an additional Template which required more fields.

I developed and tested all CRUD actions with cURL scripts.

## Client

I used bootstrap as a tool for creating a clean, user-friendly interface with the browser template.  Modals are used for all authentication.  The interface is responsive and can be used on mobile devices.  VERIFY THIS

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:
- add a pet so I can track their medical history.
- keep track of these things for my pet:  species, name, DOB, age, spayed/neutered, gender, breed, color, purchase date, microchip #, weight, vaccine history, Veterinarian contact info, and prescription information.
- make changes to any of the information concerning my pet, their medications or vaccines.
- delete a pet.

### Challenges
-   Completing the project within the given timeframe.

## Approach
I chose this as my capstone because, within the past month, both of my pets at home have been in the emergency room and vets office for urgent health issues.  Because I wasn't at home, I didn't have information about their prescription meds, last shot dates, etc.  It would have been much easier to have their medical info available by using a site/app like this!

I decided that I would create two resource tables in addition to user, one for the pet and one for the pet's prescription meds.

I felt like Express/Mongo would be a good choice for a back end, and I wanted more experience using that framework.  Taking into consideration the timeframe in which we have to develop the app, I chose the browser template rather than using a front end framework.
